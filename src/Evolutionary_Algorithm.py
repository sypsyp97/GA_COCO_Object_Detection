"""Function Signature:
def create_first_population(population: int = 100, num_classes: int = 5) -> np.ndarray

Parameters:
population: An integer representing the number of models in the initial population. Defaults to 100.
num_classes: An integer representing the number of classes in the classification task. Defaults to 5.

Returns:
A NumPy array of shape (population, 9, 18) representing the initial population of models.


Description: The "create_first_population" function creates an initial population of "population" models, where each 
model is represented as a binary array of shape (9, 18). Each element of the binary array represents a parameter for 
a specific layer operation.
The function first generates a random binary array of shape (9, 18) for each model in the initial population. It then 
creates a model from each binary array and checks if it satisfies certain constraints using the "check_model" 
function. If the model does not satisfy the constraints, the function generates a new random binary array for the 
model and tries again until a valid model is found.

The function returns a NumPy array representing the initial population of models.

Parameters:

time: A string representing the current time.
population_array: A NumPy array of shape (population, 9, 18) representing the initial population of models.

Returns:
A tuple containing: A list of NumPy arrays representing the binary arrays of the top 5 models with the highest 
fitness values in the current generation. A float representing the highest fitness value in the current generation. A 
float representing the average fitness value in the current generation. 

Description: The "select_models" function trains the models in the current population, evaluates their fitness 
values, and selects the top 5 models with the highest fitness values to pass on to the next generation. For each 
model in the population, the function creates a Keras model from the binary array representation, trains the model on 
the training and validation datasets, converts the model to a TensorFlow Lite model, evaluates the accuracy of the 
model on the test dataset using the "evaluate_tflite_model" function, and measures the inference time of the model on 
the Edge TPU using the "inference_time_tpu" function. The fitness value of the model is then calculated using the 
"calculate_fitness" function.

The function returns a tuple containing:

A list of the top 5 models with the highest fitness values in the current generation. Each model is represented as a 
binary array of shape (9, 18). The highest fitness value in the current generation. The average fitness value in the
